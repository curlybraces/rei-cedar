### <span class="modifiers">Modifiers</span>

Modifiers can be combined 1 from each grouping.

{contrast, overlay, standalone} **OR** button

Use of the 'button' modifier depends on including the css for cdrButton.

A modifier list that contains 'button' exposes the same modifiers as cdrButton and the other modifiers shouldn't be combined with it.
