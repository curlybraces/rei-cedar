# REI Cedar Style Framework!
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rei/rei-cedar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rei/rei-cedar)

Welcome to REI's style framework! The overall goals of this project are to provide a common scaffolding for UI elements,
and a set of themes that build on this scaffolding. We started this project in 2015 as a fork of
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and have applied many of the concepts from [Semantic-ui](http://semantic-ui.com/).
The project has evolved into what it is today, and will continue to grow to fit our expanding needs. Feel free to watch
the Cedar grow and learn from what we are doing, or jump in and provide some recommendations.

The goal, at this point, is to generate multiple themed CSS resources that different web properties can consume.
In time, we will explore more atomic theming that will allow page creators to mix and match themes: essentially becoming
a theme generator.

This project will work in conjunction with an upcoming component framework that is in the works.  Stay tuned for that!

## Build

To build the CSS bundle, run `gulp`. The built bundle(s) will appear in
`dist/*.css`

To fetch the latest design tokens from brand.ai run `gulp get-tokens`.

## Docs

To generate the documentation site locally, follow these steps:

1. Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) 2.5.x with
   `sudo gem install jekyll -v '>= 2.5'`
    - **Windows:** See ["Run Jekyll on Windows"](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/)
1. Install [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) with `sudo gem install rouge`
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/download/) with `brew install node`
1. From the project root directory, run `npm install` to install the project's
   Node dependencies

### Usage

1. From the project root directory, run `gulp` to build the site
1. Run `jekyll serve` to start a local dev server
1. Open http://localhost:9002 in your browser, and voilà!

## Contribution
1. Pull patterns.rei.com.
1. Create a branch and when you are finished open a PR.
1. Once it builds and is successful, all you need is one approver from the REI dev team.
1. Someone from the REI cedar team will merge the PR.

## Accessibility Audits and Testing

** Note: The following in currently in development.**

Accessibility audits can be performed against the generated documentation or on the templates used for the
documentation. We plan to following the rules defined within [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/](WCAG 2.0).

* `npm run accessibility:audit-templates` will audit the template files.
* `npm run accessibility:audit-docs` will audit the generated documentation.

### Additional Audits

In addition to a11y, we have added audits using [pa11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pa11y). These audits offer more
coverage, but with some limitation. pa11y offers a lot more coverage, but does not include DOM references to correct
errors. And it cannot audit local static files.

- `gulp accessibility:audit-pa11y`

### Visual Regression Testing

Check [backstop](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) for general configuration questions.

Our visual regressions audits can be performed against all patterns documented within the patterns site. To do so, follow the steps below:

1. Build docs and start your jekyll server
2. `npm run reference` will create a base set of images providing coverage for all defined patterns. Ensure this is run against a clean build prior to any edits.
3. `npm run compare` after making changes to the markup or css. This will create another set of test images and compare them against those generated in the previous step.
4. Review the generated report that should open in your browser. Make sure all changes are what you expect.
5. `npm run approve` if everything looks good. This will promote the latest test images to be the new reference images that future tests will be compared against.

#### Notes about our backstop configuration

We’re aliasing the backstop commands to use `npm run <command>` just to abstract away supplying the config option since we are using a javascript version of the backstop config file to dynamically generate most of it. By using the js format instead of the standard json, we can avoid having a monolithic config file and instead have more localized, manageable configs that can remove some repetition and allow for different stateful tests, like hover, more easily.

The config (__backstop.js__) looks through `docs_src/` for all __*.backstop.js__ files and turns them into the proper json format for backstop. A backstop scenario object is generated for each _selector_ in the array as well as each _onReadyScript_ if any are supplied to the _onReadyScripts_ array. Those scripts allow us to do things like hover or set the element to a disabled state for testing those. Each selector/onReadyScript will generate it’s own scenario because you can only do things like hover for one element at a time via casper.

Casper scripts live in `backstop_data > casper_scripts`

__*.backstop.js__ files will export an array of objects that are standard backstop scenario objects and support all the same options noted in the docs with the following exceptions:

1. `onReadyScripts` is something we’ve added to auto generate a scenario for each script.

if supplying an `onReadyScripts` array __AND__ you want a screenshot of the element in its normal state, one of the states will be false (examples below)

```javascript
"onReadyScripts": [false, "hover.js", "disabled.js"]
```

This will take normal, hover, and disabled screenshots.

```javascript
"onReadyScripts": ["hover.js", "disabled.js"]
```

This will take ONLY hover and disabled screenshots.

### Screenshot Files

Screenshots are all named with the value from the example's data attribute, `data-example-id`. They are also prefixed
with the section it came from.
```bash
components-panel-with-heading_138.png
# Page: /components
# data-example-id: panel-with-heading
```

REI Cedar is a living, working project and will continue to grow, and change. Just like any healthy tree, this one will
lose limbs and may change direction at times.
